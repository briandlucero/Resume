                        Throughout my diverse professional career, I have consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to excellence and innovation across a variety of roles. As an Owner and Operations Manager at Pharmaid Drugstore, I managed all aspects of daily operations, driving increased sales revenue through the use of strategic initiatives, while also applying data-driven insights to make purchasing decisions, and always ensuring all business practices met regulatory standards. My expertise in finance was further developed during my time at Wells Fargo, where I began my journey as a Customer Sales and Service Representative, then advanced to a Personal Banker, and ultimately to a Personal Banker 2 - Registered, during which I developed expertise in client relationship management, and in providing financial advice. I provided clients with personalized recommendations to help them with their financial goals, and also developed strong client relationships by providing a consistently excellent level of customer service. I also worked as a Securities Operations Service Specialist at Wells Fargo International Solutions, further developing my skills in financial analysis, and enhancing my abilities to manage financial transactions and respond to complex inquiries, while upholding the highest operational standards. In all of my experiences, I have always taken key initiative to learn new skills, provide excellent service, and create innovative solutions that have helped me to meet, and exceed, all of my goals.
